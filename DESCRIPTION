Description: Writing interfaces to commandline software is cumbersome. 
    'cmdfun' provides a framework for building function calls to seemlessly 
    interface with shell commands by allowing lazy evaluation of commandline arguments. 
    'cmdfun' also provides methods for handling user-specific paths to tool installs or secrets like API keys. 
    Its focus is to equally serve package builders who wish to wrap commandline software, and to help analysts stay inside 
    R when they might usually leave to execute non-R software.
